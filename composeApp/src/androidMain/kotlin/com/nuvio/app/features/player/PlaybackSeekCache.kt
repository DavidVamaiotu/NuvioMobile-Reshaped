/**
 * Disk read-ahead for ExoPlayer, sized by [PlaybackBufferSettings].

 * ExoPlayer's own buffer lives on the Java heap, so it is capped well below the setting. Here one
 * connection reads the stream ahead of playback into a ring file of the chosen size and the
 * player reads from that file, so seeks anywhere inside it need no network. Parts behind
 * playback are overwritten: only what is coming up is kept.
 *
 * It stands in for the player's own connection rather than adding one: a seek outside the ring
 * moves the read-ahead there, so the stream never has more than one connection. The ring is a
 * temporary file, deleted when playback ends and at every launch.
